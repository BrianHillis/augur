Use case 1: Home Page redesign 

    System requirements
    
      - This use case requires accessing the length of the array holding each github repository link. This is done through a for loop that accesses each project in the repos array and getting the number of repositories in the project.
      
      - This use case also changes the style of the page to allow for overflow to display multiple projects. 
      
    Design Decisions
    
      - I chose to add the number of repos stat in the head of the table for easy viewing and to eliminate the repition of displaying the stat with each link
      
      - I chose to allow for overflow of the project cards instead of a list of projects with the number of repos stat that acted as a link to a new page that displayed all the repo links because this allowed for more information to be displayed on the current interface.
      
    Database Usage
    
      - This use case did not end up needing to make any changes to the database, only access information that was already retrieved from it.

Use case 2:
    
    
Use case 3:
